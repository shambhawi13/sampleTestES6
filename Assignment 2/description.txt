For all the 3 function, enter values from prompt and output can be seen in console.

1st function takes season number and episode number as input and iterates through the json and if the match is found, displays detail in console

2nd function takes array of episode ids through prompt and again searches for that list of ids and displays the deatil.
In above example prompt is written for 2 inputs only but the function is coded in such a way that it can take multiple arguments.

3rd function takes episode name as input.
Case insensitive comparison is done in above function
